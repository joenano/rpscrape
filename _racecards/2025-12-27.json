When he asked him to quicken up he put it to bed very nicely. I think he is a five-furlong horse, but we will probably have to try the six (furlongs) later down the line. He was sold to go to Hong Kong, but he worked very well at mine so I asked if I could run him at York. He ran at York and won, and we decided to go for one more today.

Aablan is quite flamboyant in his early paces, so it's key to conserve that energy and the race couldn't have worked out much better. We were able to get some cover, which helped and he was soon nicely under control. He gets through the line well, so I was keen to let him go through his paces. He hasn't got an electric turn of foot but I knew this distance would be perfect with a stiff finish. Going further will be better for him. With this fella, a lot will depend on how he takes his races, so I don't think Charlie will be in a great rush to make a decision on a target.
