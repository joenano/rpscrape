He enjoys plenty of cut in the ground and opportunities could be limited during the summer months, so we might try him on the all-weather this week and if he handles that it would give us more scope. Being a German-bred you might expect him to stay further, but he's happy over a mile. We'll have to see how he gets on with a 9lb rise, but we have to take our medicine.

We gave him one run last season before putting him away and bringing him back at Stratford, where he ran a nice race to be third over 2m3½f. Stepping him up to 3m clearly had the desired effect as he won next time out at Ffos Las. It was a big step forward from him and clearly staying chasing is his game. He jumped very well at the Welsh track and got every inch of the 3m. We could head up to Newcastle on Thursday with him as there a couple of options there for him. He is up to a mark of 100 now and I would like to think from what he has done so far that there is more in the tank. 21-11-22"}],"stats":{"horse":{"course":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"3","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"7","wins":"1"}},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"0","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"-","last_14_profit":"0.00","ovr_runs":"6","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-6.00"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"2","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"50%","last_14_profit":"+15.00","ovr_runs":"0","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"-","ovr_profit":"0.00"}},"trainer":"James Evans","trainer_14_days":{"runs":5,"wins":1,"percent":20},"trainer_id":8254,"trainer_location":"Kinnersley, Worcs","trainer_rtf":60,"ts":94,"wind_surgery_first":false,"wind_surgery_second":false},{"age":7,"breeder":"Hugh J Holohan","breeder_id":4796,"claim":null,"colour":"B","comment":"Blinkered on last two starts, running creditably on first occasion but not on latest","dam":"One Edge","dam_id":648914,"dam_region":"IRE","damsire":"Welsh Term","damsire_id":302687,"damsire_region":"IRE","dob":"2018-05-13","draw":null,"form":"-53P45","gelding_first_time":false,"headgear":"b","headgear_first":false,"horse_id":4857575,"jockey":"Jack Quinlan","jockey_allowance":null,"jockey_id":87528,"last_run":14,"lbs":159,"medical":[],"name":"Edgewell","non_runner":false,"number":5,"ofr":91,"owner":"Lads That Lunch","owner_id":364140,"prev_owners":[{"owner":"E A Brook","owner_id":15819,"change_date":"2025-10-31"},{"owner":"Exors Of The Late John Wade","owner_id":351425,"change_date":"2025-01-28"},{"owner":"John Wade","owner_id":4217,"change_date":"2024-12-03"}],"prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Rebecca Menzies","trainer_id":28511,"change_date":"2025-10-31"}],"profile":"4857575/edgewell","quotes":[],"region":"IRE","reserve":false,"rpr":106,"sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","silk_path":"0/4/1/364140","silk_url":"https://www.rp-assets.com/svg/0/4/1/364140.svg","sire":"Well Chosen","sire_id":441502,"sire_region":"GB","spotlight":"Chase winner in Ireland in 2024 and dual hurdles winner in Britain this February; battled on from a poor position when creditable fourth at Windsor (3m, good to soft) in November with first-time blinkers, which have been kept since; he was not similarly motivated at Wincanton two weeks ago, however.","stable_tour":[{"horse":"Edgewell","horse_id":4857575,"quote":"He'd been a very disappointing horse but has shown plenty of ability at home and maybe the quirky nature of Downpatrick brought the best out of him when he won there last week, albeit it wasn't the strongest race.
