But he was still babyish - offspring of Walk In The Park can be a bit like that - and he nearly ran away with Harry on the way to the start. In the race he was much too free, could finish only fourth and it was back to the drawing board. Another defeat followed but I knew it was just a question of giving him time to mature and grow up. By the time Aintree came along he was a different horse; a hood helped him settle better in the Grade 1 Mersey and he was headed only close home. The winner gave the form a big boost at Punchestown. Now as a novice chaser he represents a challenge; he could be a slow learner like he was over hurdles, but if he improves as much as I think he can he'll be very exciting. The signs are looking good: he has grown up over the summer and seems much more settled in his work at home. He was fine when we took him for a racecourse gallop at Newbury last week.

Last season's victory, which meant his form figures in the race now stand at 431, was thoroughly deserved as it had taken an age for his rating to come down. An 8lb hike for that success meant it was game over as far as he was concerned and he's been well held in five outings since. But he's slipped back down the weights again and he'll be just 1lb higher than 12 months ago in the Paddy Power.

We had him right for his return in the Kerry National and he was running a massive race but, unfortunately, he hit a fence and unseated Sam [Twiston-Davies]. The ground dried up at Wetherby and the race came at the right time. He's come out of it really well and we had him in the Betfair Chase but took him out on the day because of the ground. With the form he's in, he could possibly run in the King George after all. We'd have to supplement him but we've looked into it. It would be ground dependent but we'll have a good idea of the ground and weather forecast by then. He finished fourth in it last year and ran very well for a first run in open company. You can run him at any track - it's the ground that's key. There's a race at Wetherby on Boxing Day as well, but we'll look at the King George because it's a wide-open race. We're still thinking of the Cotswold Chase and then the Gold Cup, but it'll depend on the ground. If the Cheltenham Festival came up soft like it did last year, we'd go the Aintree route. There's the Bowl and we'll probably put him in the Grand National as well.
