He is always backing off a bit which makes it hard work for you, but he has stuck his head down and galloped all the way to the line. He was brilliant at the last, but he needed that. The second horse is no mug as we have been up against him this summer with Centara. His jumping just cost him at Newton Abbot a little bit. It is all experience, and this is what novice chases are about getting experience for the future. I'm delighted with him. Windsor might be a bit tight for him, and he doesn't want it too soft as he went there last year and hated it. He can't be silly handicapped over fences if you take his two runs over fences.

We'll now seek to continue following a well-worn path and look at the Elite at Wincanton on Saturday, a race he has also won for the last two years. Alternatively, he could switch to the Haldon Gold Cup a day earlier if the ground at Exeter came up too fast for Kalif Du Berlais. His chasing career, which I'd long looked forward to, had been delayed last season because he was doing so well over hurdles, mopping up those Grade 2 prizes with regularity. He finally got to jump fences in public at Christmas when outclassed behind Sir Gino. We then lowered his sights and he gave L'Eau Du Sud a fright in the Kingmaker before winning the Grade 2 Pendil, a contest we love to target. That victory, over 2m4f, gives us more options for this season, as does the fact he coped surprisingly well with the soft ground at Warwick and Kempton. Whatever happens later this week, it will be fences after that and we'll look for a valuable pot on a flat, right-handed track - something at Ascot would suit ideally.

He was probably a little bit further back than he wanted to be, but Charlie was adamant that once he switches off, he has plenty of pace. They went a strong pace and it all worked out well for him.
