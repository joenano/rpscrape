I train for Canisbay, who have a lot of horses based at Epsom but some with me as well. Michael Attwater had a really good time with Tadreeb but then he lost his form a little bit and the owner decided he wanted to see if a change of scenery would do him good. We haven't got the gallops and facilities of Epsom - we're a small family-run business and have our own gallops - but sometimes these horses appreciate a bit of an easier regime. We gave him a nice rest through last summer and he won his first few races when we brought him back in January. Unfortunately, he pulled a muscle, which is why he's missed a bit of the season, but he's come back in good form. He's seven now, so he isn't going to get any better, but he's won three and been placed several times this year.

It is just nice to see him progress from that first Cheltenham run over hurdles. He is enjoying this now. If we can keep getting his form to rise over hurdles, we will come back on the Flat as he is still a young horse. We have always thought he is a horse that stays well and to be placed in an English and Irish Derby you have to stay well. It is just teaching him to run at fifteen seconds a furlong and not twelve seconds, but he is starting to do it. I was worried coming here on soft ground, but they have got to learn, and it was nice to see him do it today. It is a relief. He settled better today and I just love the way he battled. Usually, flat horses give up when they get headed, but he battled well and stayed well. We are still a long way off, but it is another small step back. He will get another couple of days' practice and the County Hurdle will be a right race for him at Cheltenham. There will be a big field, and they will go quick enough for him early on, and he will stay on well up the hill.

There's been a few seconds and he's been unlucky in life, but he's run 75 times and won more than 70,000GBP in prize money, so we feel fortunate to have him around. He's been incredibly sound, we've never had a problem with him, and he'll be out in the paddock before he goes to bed. He's an amazing horse and we're delighted he's done it. My son Fergus rang me up and mentioned the visor. We've had the blinkers on and off to keep him sweet but luckily it worked.
